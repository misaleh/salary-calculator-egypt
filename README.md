## SALARY CALCULATOR EGYPT 

**Current Version**: 1.1

Salary Calculator is just a simple program I made to calculate my salary :moneybag: :nerd_face:

### How to use
**Compile for command line version**

```
make
```

**Run **

```
./salary_calculator.bin
```
**Compile for GUI**

yo can use QT creator to build the project from it, or build from shell as follows:

```
cd GUI
```

```
qmake SalaryCalculator.pro &&make qmake_all
```
```
make
```
**Run **
```
./SalaryCalculator (or just double click :sweat_smile:)
```


### Dependencies
* QT for gui (originally developed with QT 5.12, however it's very simple, it should compile with older versions)
### TODO
 * ~~Create a GUI~~
 * ~~Add Arabic language support~~
